# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of my projects, notebooks, and analyses, demonstrating my skills in data scienceâ€”from data wrangling and analysis to machine learning and data visualization.

## Portfolio Highlights
This repository includes a variety of projects demonstrating key data science competencies:
- **Data Analysis & Visualization:** In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) and compelling visualizations using libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- **Machine Learning:** End-to-end projects covering regression, classification, and clustering models with Scikit-Learn.
- **Data Wrangling & Cleaning:** Scripts and notebooks showing techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing complex datasets for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Application of statistical methods to derive meaningful insights from data.
