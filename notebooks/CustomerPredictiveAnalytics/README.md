Project: Customer Segmentation using K-Means (my first Kaggle notebook)

How to run:
1. Open `kmeans.ipynb` in Kaggle notebooks or local Jupyter.
2. Upload the dataset `Mall_Customers_Enhanced.csv` to the notebook environment (Kaggle: add as input dataset).
3. Run cells top-to-bottom. Outputs: `customer_segments_results.csv` and `segment_classifier_rf.pkl`.

Notes:
- This is a basic educational kernel: K-Means clustering + a RandomForest classifier to predict segment labels.
- Keep random_state=42 for reproducible results.
